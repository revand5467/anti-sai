# HackAthena
Project repo for HackAthena'23  
This project was done as part of HackAthena hackathon held at JEC Cheruthuruthy. 

## Project description
Drug menace can be combated in various ways. One such way is through anonymous reporting. SoberHaven is one such reporting platform wherein you can anonymously report a tip
to the police. In doing so you have to upload a supporting document like an image or a video clip, audio clip etc.. This platform is visible to the authorities as well as 
NGOs and the common people. Once you have uploaded a post on this platform it will be verified by the police and the maintaining authority to ensure it's validity. If the said 
information is fake in nature, pending approval from the police that post will be taken down. The valid posts are visible to others. Based on this the authorities can take
action and catch the culprits or peddlers in the area.
